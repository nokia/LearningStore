If you're like most business leaders, you'd say it's fundamentally about relationships - and you'd be wrong. The best salespeople don't just build relationships with customers. They challenge them.The need to understand what top-performing reps are doing that their average performing colleagues are not drove Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at Corporate Executive Board to investigate the skills, behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes that matter most for high performance. And what they discovered may be the biggest shock to conventional sales wisdom in decades. </p><p>Based on an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps across multiple industries and geographies, The Challenger Sale argues that classic relationship building is a losing approach, especially when it comes to selling complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions. The authors' study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one-the Challenger- delivers consistently high performance.Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer's specific needs and objectives. Rather than acquiescing to the customer's every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale. </p>",

Forced by the marketplace, competition, and economic conditions, the world's most prestigious research lab is in the midst of radical cultural change.</p><p>Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel tells the interesting story of this change. The boom years of basic research started to end when AT&T shed its monopoly status and entered the competitive marketplace. The change, slow at first, sped up in the 1990s with the next breakup of AT&T, which created Lucent, Bell Labs' new parent. After a few good years, Lucent found itself in financial difficulty in a very tough telecommunications market. Lucent responded by breaking up into smaller companies, which led to a smaller Bell Labs. In addition, Lucent's worsening financial condition forced Bell Labs to downsize.</p><p>Bell Labs researchers, who once were free to focus on innovation, research excellence, now have to worry about business relevance. The culture of lifetime employment is gone and the pendulum has swung from basic to applied research.</p><p>Narain Gehani worked at Bell Labs for twenty-three years from 1978 to 2001. He was there when AT&T went from a monopoly to a competitive company. He was there when AT&T split up again and handed Bell Labs to Lucent. He was there during the rise and fall of Lucent. He was a witness to and participant in the changes in Bell Labs as its parent morphed from a million employee company to a fifty thousand employee company.</p><p>Narain Gehani shares his insights about Bell Labs and its culture. He describes its glorious history and the events that made Bell Labs the greatest lab of the twentieth century. He describes the cultural differences between Research and the business units, the different research models and the challenges facing Bell. Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel is full of interesting and amusing anecdotes. Narain Gehani's tale of a corporate crown jewel will keep you riveted to reading about a way of life possibly gone forever.</p>",

The book covers everything from the most likely use cases to a wide range of technology options and potential 5G system architectures, and serves as an essential reference for academics and professionals involved in wireless and mobile communications.</p><p>5G cellular communications will be a game changer in the ICT industry and beyond, envisioned to enable pervasive connectivity between humans and things, and foster the so-called 4th industrial revolution as the next leap in industrial automation. While 5G research started several years ago, there is still the need for consensus in the industry and in standardization bodies on the exact architecture and functional design of the 5G system, before first commercial roll-outs can be expected in the 2020 timeframe.</p>",

        "Description": "Today people rely more and more on mobile devices and 'one-way' communication tools that they often use under the guise of being 'social.' Although it's possible to learn to communicate interpersonally using only technology, it's not always the best or most efficient way to achieve your intended communication outcomes, which are most typically to inform, give feedback, or influence. Interpersonal communication is just that \u2013 personal. So the further you stray from communication methods that are rich in personal attributes (you can hear someone, see someone, use body language, interact with others) versus light in personal attributes (impersonal, one-way, static), the more apt you are to have a one-way, 'telling' type of communication. In this course, you'll learn how to select the best communication methods to convey your intention and target your audience. By doing so, you improve the odds of getting your message across, making your point, and leaving your audience feeling informed, enlightened, and engaged.",
        "Objectives": "<p>Making Sense of Communication Methods</p><p>- choose interpersonal communication methods that are most appropriate based on your intention</p><p>- recognize how factors other than intention inform your decision on which method to use for your interpersonal communications</p><p>- improve the effectiveness of e-mails</p><p>recognize ways to plan, deliver, and connect with your audience during face-to-face interpersonal communications</p><p>- use a process to communicate feedback in an effective, constructive manner</p><p>- choose effective, efficient communication methods that properly convey intent</p>",

In this course, you'll explore how a clear intention drives a communication, and how understanding your audience ensures that the message gets delivered. You'll also learn how verbal signals, nonverbal behavior, and emotional intelligence can help make or break your communications",

Thinking like a chief financial officer, or CFO, in your everyday decision making and management can help you achieve these goals. Adopting a CFO mind-set will give you a better understanding of your organization's financial priorities and assist you in getting your CFO's buy-in for your budgets, project plans, and proposals requiring investment.

This course presents some examples of how a CFO perspective is applied to many of the activities and financial decisions you make in your area of business on a daily basis.

This course introduces you to a process for managing regulatory and financial risks in line with CFO priorities. It begins by focusing on general actions you can take to support CFO priorities for risk management and compliance.

In traditional projects, product testing is implemented prior to a single release phase. However in the agile software testing life cycle, testing will be implemented on software produced during each iteration. </p><p>Additionally, agile approaches and artifacts such as user stories incorporate test-driven approaches from the outset of the project. </p><p>This path is intended to align with the Agile Tester Certified Tester Foundations Level Extension Syllabus. </p><p>The authors, Rex Black, Anders Claesson, Gerry Coleman, Bertrand Cornanguer, Istvan Forgacs, Alon Linetzki, Tilo Linz, Leo van der Aalst, Marie Walsh, and Stephan Weber, and the International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB\u00ae) are the source and copyright owners of the Syllabus. </p><p>The path is intended to help learners prepare for the Agile Tester Foundation Extension certification(CTFL-AT) exam,which is provided by the Information Systems Examination Board (ISEB), a globally-recognized testing body providing software testing certification. </p><p>SkillSoft makes no claim to any approval or endorsement of this course by any of the aforementioned parties or other third party.</p>",
        "Objectives": "<p>In this learning path, you'll review the principles underpinning agile development and some of the principle agile methodologies. </p><p>You'll learn about testing in the agile contextand the skillset that an agile tester should have. The path will also cover specific techniques for agile testing and the tools available to agile testers. </p>",

        "Description": "Six Sigma is a data-driven improvement philosophy that views all activities within an organization as processes whose inputs can be controlled to effect significant improvements in process outputs. Six Sigma uses a rigorous and systematic methodology known as DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and a number of qualitative and quantitative tools for driving process, product, and service improvements aimed at reducing defects and variation. Lean is also an improvement methodology, but with a different focus, aiming to enhance process flow, reduce cycle time, and eliminate waste. Though Lean and Six Sigma originated in different places and under different circumstances, they are now largely seen as complementary methodologies rather than mutually exclusive alternatives. Companies across various industries are striving to become faster and more responsive to customers, achieve near perfect quality, and operate using world-class cost structures. You need both Lean and Six Sigma to achieve these goals. This course explores the relationship between the Lean and Six Sigma approaches and their integrated application in both manufacturing and service industries. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft\u2019s ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.",

He's obviously upset and discouraged over his weak start. If you were Tushar's supervisor, what would you do? Situations like this one can cause managers to start worrying and begin talking about disciplinary action. However, leaders take a different approach. A leader would take the time to coach Tushar and find out what's really going on\u2014perhaps determining that three weeks of training wasn't quite enough. Or perhaps discovering that Tushar's mother died recently and he's struggling to concentrate. Or offering to find a mentor for Tushar until the situation is better. Taking the time to evaluate a situation and making an action plan is part of the process of coaching for performance that you'll explore in this course. You'll learn when it's appropriate to mentor, train, counsel or discipline an employee and you'll be given guidelines and tips on how to perform each of these tasks in the most effective manner possible.",

Effective listening requires more than just courage; it also requires constant learning and practice. To prepare for effective listening, you need to identify and overcome the barriers that stand in the way of effective listening. You also need to be an attentive, empathetic and active listener. When you employ the technique of active listening, you focus your attention completely on the speaker, listen carefully for meaning and then use feedback to verify that you've correctly understood the communication. This course explores the benefits and challenges of effective listening and demonstrates how active listening techniques enhance the effectiveness of your listening skills. It takes you through the various levels of listening and outlines behaviours and thought patterns that demonstrate active listening techniques. Finally, it emphasises the important skill of providing listener feedback to demonstrate or clarify understanding of the speaker's communication.",

Perhaps, you worry about being ignored or not connecting with anyone and fear that awkward feeling of standing alone, off to the side. Do you wonder why people seem to be drawn to certain individuals in the room? Those individuals probably faced the same feelings of uncertainty entering the room as you did, but the difference may be that they appear to be more approachable than you do. Approachability involves conveying your willingness to reach out and invite others in by initiating contact, making yourself available and building rapport. This course is designed to give you an understanding of how to build skills to become more approachable. You'll learn about the benefits of being approachable, as well as some techniques you can use to enhance your ability to reach out and invite others in. You'll also learn about putting people at ease when you're communicating and building rapport using skills such as listening, harmonising and sharing to ensure that people see how approachable you are.",

Your people must develop an understanding of the strategy, and your work processes must be tightly aligned to maximize organizational performance. So how do you communicate strategy and secure alignment? Strategy needs to be translated from high-level themes into individual strategic goals. Otherwise, the strategy will be difficult to execute. Operational processes must work together to achieve goals because strategic progress is faster when business units are aligned, rather than working in isolation. This course offers techniques for effectively communicating a common understanding of the mission, values, and vision that drives your strategy. You'll learn how to cascade balanced scorecard objectives to help employees understand how department strategy and their personal work connect to organizational goals. The course also explains the importance of incentives to achieve objectives and of evaluating organizational competencies to develop employees who can execute your organizational strategy.",

        "Description": "Before you can decide how to manage your time better, you need to recognise how you manage your time now. Busy people do what is required and rarely have the opportunity to stop and consider whether they are making the best use of their time. A brief analysis of what you do currently may surprise you, and it may help you to identify some changes that could be made. This course will help you to consider the activities that currently take up most of your time and how you plan and log them. You will also be encouraged to consider the work-life balance to which you aspire, and what steps you could take to make this wish a reality. Each of us is different, and this surely affects the way in which we approach time management. Some people habitually wake early and find that the morning is the best time for them to handle creative tasks or difficult problems; others prefer to rise and work late\u2014these people probably prefer to tackle only easy, routine tasks in the morning. Our personalities also play a significant role in the way we handle tasks and manage time. You are probably already doing certain things well, but there will surely be areas that can be improved. The last lesson in this course will help you to approach these changes in a positive and useful way.",

And mapping out what a process or system will look like with requirements in place provides a detailed view for the team to work towards.</p></li><li><p>A business analyst doesn't just come up with a viable solution to address a business need. A business analyst is also responsible for studying the viability of the proposed solution within the organization, identifying what is required within the organization to make the solution work, and validating and evaluating the solution performance.</p></li><li><p>The first step in creating any solution is to review stakeholder needs and analyze what tools are available to address those needs. Without understanding stakeholder requirements, you may find a solution to the wrong problem. And without understanding the tools and technologies involved, you may aim for impossible goals.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>Courses will also assist in preparing for the IIBA\u00ae\u2019s Certified Business Analysis Professional\u2122 (CBAP\u00ae) certification exam.

Second, all employees must be empowered to take ownership. This holistic transformation wrenches the status quo and provokes a strong focus where customers and employees matter.",
