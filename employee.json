By providing\ntransparency for nearly all costs across Nokia, potential risks can be flagged\nand mitigated if needed, improving our financial sustainability. Each Color\nBook affects a different part of the overall costs. All together, the Color\nBooks covered more than 95% of the total cost baseline of Nokia Networks in\n2015. Each Color Book focuses on a single dedicated cost baseline and the\nimpact of multiple initiatives and measures on it. The Color Books support the\nvarious initiatives through the calculation of their business cases and the\nexecution of cost improvement measures with a direct link to the P&L.<o:p></o:p></p>",

    "Description": "<p>Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. </p><p>Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. </p><p>In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. </p><p>Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.</p>",
    "Objectives": "<p>This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include:</p><p> (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). </p><p>(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).</p><p>(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). </p><p>The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.</p>",

In other words, understanding who you're talking to is as important as understanding what you're trying to communicate. Additionally, it is important to understand the role the medium, context and other variables have on the communication process so you can optimise factors that are under your control. To confirm that your message was understood, the final step in the communication process is asking for and reviewing feedback from your audience.</p><p>This course explores key considerations for planning and delivering targeted messages. It highlights the components involved in communication and describes what to look for while analysing the needs and wants of your intended audience - even if it is an audience of one.

One way to avoid this is to have a sound structure. Once you have identified the purpose and audience for the presentation, and come up with some ideas for what to say, you can transform those ideas into a script or notes that will guide you through the presentation. You should start with an introduction, where you grab the attention of the audience and tell what you are going to do. Next, you need to support each of your key points and, at the same time, not lose the attention of the audience. At the end of your presentation, you need to give your audience a clear understanding of what happens next. You also must make your ending compelling. After all, this is how the audience will remember you. </p><p>This course describes how to make these key parts of a presentation – the introduction, support content, and conclusion – memorable and effective.

This course describes how to make your delivery successful and memorable. It covers techniques for managing stage fright – the biggest problem most speakers have.

    "Description": "<p>This audio edition discusses how sales reps can successfully reframe customers’ expectations and deliver a distinctive purchase experience that drives higher levels of customer loyalty and, ultimately, greater growth. </p><p>What's the secret to sales success? If you're like most business leaders, you'd say it's fundamentally about relationships - and you'd be wrong. The best salespeople don't just build relationships with customers. They challenge them.The need to understand what top-performing reps are doing that their average performing colleagues are not drove Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at Corporate Executive Board to investigate the skills, behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes that matter most for high performance. And what they discovered may be the biggest shock to conventional sales wisdom in decades. </p><p>Based on an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps across multiple industries and geographies, The Challenger Sale argues that classic relationship building is a losing approach, especially when it comes to selling complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions. The authors' study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one-the Challenger- delivers consistently high performance.Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer's specific needs and objectives. Rather than acquiescing to the customer's every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale. </p>"

Forced by the marketplace, competition, and economic conditions, the world's most prestigious research lab is in the midst of radical cultural change.</p><p>Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel tells the interesting story of this change. The boom years of basic research started to end when AT&T shed its monopoly status and entered the competitive marketplace. The change, slow at first, sped up in the 1990s with the next breakup of AT&T, which created Lucent, Bell Labs' new parent. After a few good years, Lucent found itself in financial difficulty in a very tough telecommunications market. Lucent responded by breaking up into smaller companies, which led to a smaller Bell Labs. In addition, Lucent's worsening financial condition forced Bell Labs to downsize.</p><p>Bell Labs researchers, who once were free to focus on innovation, research excellence, now have to worry about business relevance. The culture of lifetime employment is gone and the pendulum has swung from basic to applied research.</p><p>Narain Gehani worked at Bell Labs for twenty-three years from 1978 to 2001. He was there when AT&T went from a monopoly to a competitive company. He was there when AT&T split up again and handed Bell Labs to Lucent. He was there during the rise and fall of Lucent. He was a witness to and participant in the changes in Bell Labs as its parent morphed from a million employee company to a fifty thousand employee company.</p><p>Narain Gehani shares his insights about Bell Labs and its culture. He describes its glorious history and the events that made Bell Labs the greatest lab of the twentieth century. He describes the cultural differences between Research and the business units, the different research models and the challenges facing Bell. Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel is full of interesting and amusing anecdotes. Narain Gehani's tale of a corporate crown jewel will keep you riveted to reading about a way of life possibly gone forever.</p>"

    "Description": "Today people rely more and more on mobile devices and 'one-way' communication tools that they often use under the guise of being 'social.' Although it's possible to learn to communicate interpersonally using only technology, it's not always the best or most efficient way to achieve your intended communication outcomes, which are most typically to inform, give feedback, or influence. Interpersonal communication is just that – personal. So the further you stray from communication methods that are rich in personal attributes (you can hear someone, see someone, use body language, interact with others) versus light in personal attributes (impersonal, one-way, static), the more apt you are to have a one-way, 'telling' type of communication. In this course, you'll learn how to select the best communication methods to convey your intention and target your audience.

    "Description": "Everyone has experienced miscommunication. Have you ever dealt with someone who seems unable to 'hear' the message you're sending? Or have you ever had to deliver a message that you knew would be hard for the other person to accept? Maybe you've even found yourself in a disagreement with someone that was so significant that it completely shut down your communication. Communication gets tough when the message is difficult. And because these challenges typically involve emotions such as hurt, anger, or confusion, it's not uncommon for people to avoid one another or shut down, preventing what could be a productive exchange at many levels. In this course, you'll examine some common communication challenges and how you can successfully navigate them. By showing patience, perseverance, and accountability, you can get communication back on track and reach mutual understanding and agreement.",
    "Objectives": "<p>Alleviating Interpersonal Communication Challenges</p><p>- recognize how to address a miscommunication that has occurred</p><p>- communicate messages that are likely to be difficult for your audience to hear</p><p>- recognize techniques for fixing or improving communications that have broken off</p><p>- work through challenging interpersonal communications</p>",

But no one likes to talk to a wall, so in many ways, the response from the communication recipient is as important as the message that's given. When you're on the receiving end of a communication, regardless of whether or not it has been planned or delivered effectively, you must try to be receptive and understand what was intended. This requires two essential skills that most everyone finds challenging to keep sharpened: listening and questioning. In this course, you'll work on sharpening those skills – as well as on getting yourself in the right receptive mind-set for communicating.",

When drawing conclusions, you analyze and weigh the data, information, and sources you have to support taking action. Even if you've verified assumptions and evaluated a variety of arguments related to an issue – you still have to reach the point of conclusion. A good conclusion is based on sorting through and out the data, getting critiques from others, and drawing it out/depicting it in a way that others can understand. In this course, you will analyze the process of drawing a conclusion into its logical components. You'll also learn about the use of questions and diagramming tools to assist in this process."

It takes the right mindset, essential communication skills and a toolbox of strategies to deftly handle any tricks the other party tries to use on you.

You must also ensure you align your decisions and departmental activities with your organization's financial goals. You can do this by investing your resources profitably, maintaining a healthy cash flow, and managing your business risks adequately. Thinking like a chief financial officer, or CFO, in your everyday decision making and management can help you achieve these goals. Adopting a CFO mind-set will give you a better understanding of your organization's financial priorities and assist you in getting your CFO's buy-in for your budgets, project plans, and proposals requiring investment.   This course provides some basic tips to get you started thinking like a CFO and explains why it's important to have that perspective."

At a more operational level, many of your decisions and managerial activities related to budgeting, managing payables and receivables, incurring incremental costs, and making purchase decisions can benefit from a CFO perspective.   This course presents some examples of how a CFO perspective is applied to many of the activities and financial decisions you make in your area of business on a daily basis.

This course teaches you how to apply a CFO perspective in preparing and presenting a business case. You are walked through the typical steps for developing and presenting a business case.

One way you express that concern is by how you deal with your department's financial, operational, and compliance risks. If you approach these like a CFO, your decisions will be more in line with organizational goals, and you'll be more likely to win senior management's support for your department's risk management plans.   This course introduces you to a process for managing regulatory and financial risks in line with CFO priorities. It begins by focusing on general actions you can take to support CFO priorities for risk management and compliance. It then presents a method for identifying and categorizing risks your department could be facing. Next it teaches a ranking technique for prioritizing risks. Finally, it suggests an approach to developing a risk response plan for departmental risks."

In this course, you will learn methods to use in gathering success factors from the sponsors and owners of the change initiative, build skills in developing initial statements of scope to support change initiatives, learn how to identify key stakeholders and stakeholder groups who must change and those who must be considered for inclusion to achieve desired change, and learn how to assess the Three Keys to Sustainable Change – discomfort, vision, and skills."

Additionally, you will need to facilitate the creation of a code for change - outlining the behaviors that will support the change and, in some instances, how members of the organization will be held accountable.

This course introduces techniques for building a cohesive team and highlights how poor communication, a trust-deficient atmosphere, and a lack of cooperation among team members leads to failure of the team achieving its goals. This course covers what needs to happen in order to reach true unity and cohesiveness, which will in turn take the team to new heights.",

    "Description": "A crucial component of optimal team performance is the ability of all team members to openly express their ideas, goals, and needs, as well as share thoughts about each other's performance – both positive and negative. The same principle applies when it comes to receiving feedback. It's far better to hear the truth directly than to assume your performance is the best it can be. In this course, you'll learn how to deliver feedback to other members of your team using a direct, honest, and assertive style that strives to eliminate uncertainty. You'll also learn techniques to help you receive and process feedback provided by other team members. Mastering this feedback loop provides an opportunity to grow as an individual, as well as improve team performance as a whole.",

This course outlines initial steps that should be performed when building a team, including establishing the team goal and assigning roles to individual team members in a way that ensures the team will collectively meet its goal. The course also discusses the importance of fully understanding one's responsibilities and how the various roles work together to achieve the goal.",

    "Description": "Every project is different. Some are small and straight forward. Others are large and complex. Most are somewhere in the middle. Even though every project is unique, they all have certain attributes in common. Every project has a similar life cycle, starting with an idea, progressing through development, and culminating in the delivery of a finished product or service. A product has a life cycle of its own which is tied into – yet distinct from – the life cycle of the project. All projects have similar overall phases, such as the start up phase, the planning and design phase, the production phase, and the closing phase. That is all straightforward, but how do a project's phases relate to the stages of its life cycle? Do the natural phases of a project affect the way it is managed? And what types of project management processes should be applied to the specific phases? These are all fundamental questions project managers ask. This course answers these questions and more. It is designed to give project managers and project team members a solid understanding about the nature of projects, how they are structured, and how the structures affect the way they are managed. Specifically, it introduces the concepts of project life cycle, product life cycle, project phases, and project management Process Groups. It provides an in depth look at how the project management phases interact with each other and with the elements of the project life cycle. The course illustrates these concepts through many examples of small and large projects. Learners will also be introduced to the fundamental source of information for project management professionals: the Project Management Institute (PMI®) and A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fifth Edition published by PMI®. The course will identify key project management concepts and terms, explore the PMBOK® Guide, and the project management Knowledge Areas. This course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date project management information so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations.

    "Description": "rojects routinely require materials, consultants, training, products, and equipment, along with many other types of goods and services. Project procurement is the process of purchasing products and services necessary to fulfill the objectives of a project. Procurements must be carefully planned and administered to ensure they do not cause a project to go over budget or fall behind schedule. In this course, learners will gain an understanding of what processes are involved in planning project procurement and how these processes interact with the overall project life cycle. Common tools and techniques for planning project procurement will be covered, including make-or-buy analysis. Learners will be introduced to the process of developing a procurement management plan and determining which procurement contract best suits the project's needs, which are both vital to ensuring a project manager is able to procure the products or services for project success. This course will assist in preparing learners for the PMI® certification exam.

    "Description": "<p>Six Sigma is a data-driven improvement philosophy that views all activities within an organization as processes whose inputs can be controlled to effect significant improvements in process outputs. Six Sigma uses a rigorous and systematic methodology known as DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control) and a number of qualitative and quantitative tools for driving process, product, and service improvements aimed at reducing defects and variation. Lean is also an improvement methodology, but with a different focus, aiming to enhance process flow, reduce cycle time, and eliminate waste. Though Lean and Six Sigma originated in different places and under different circumstances, they are now largely seen as complementary methodologies rather than mutually exclusive alternatives. Companies across various industries are striving to become faster and more responsive to customers, achieve near perfect quality, and operate using world-class cost structures. You need both Lean and Six Sigma to achieve these goals. This course explores the relationship between the Lean and Six Sigma approaches and their integrated application in both manufacturing and service industries. This course is aligned with the ASQ Certified Six Sigma Black Belt certification exam and is designed to assist learners as part of their exam preparation. It builds on foundational knowledge that is taught in SkillSoft’s ASQ-aligned Green Belt curriculum.</p>",

    "Description": "<p>Tushar is new at quality control. He completed three weeks of training, but he has already made two major errors that cost the firm Rs. 1,50,000. He's obviously upset and discouraged over his weak start. If you were Tushar's supervisor, what would you do? Situations like this one can cause managers to start worrying and begin talking about disciplinary action. However, leaders take a different approach. A leader would take the time to coach Tushar and find out what's really going on—perhaps determining that three weeks of training wasn't quite enough. Or perhaps discovering that Tushar's mother died recently and he's struggling to concentrate. Or offering to find a mentor for Tushar until the situation is better. Taking the time to evaluate a situation and making an action plan is part of the process of coaching for performance that you'll explore in this course. You'll learn when it's appropriate to mentor, train, counsel or discipline an employee and you'll be given guidelines and tips on how to perform each of these tasks in the most effective manner possible.</p>",

    "Description": "Effective communication in the workplace can be a balancing act. If you're too passive, you may have trouble getting others to do what you want. If you're too aggressive, you may turn people off. Getting what you want in the workplace requires a balance of assertiveness without aggressiveness. This course will guide you as you move into a more straightforward and more effective communication style. You'll learn about the benefits of assertive behaviour and how to distinguish it from passive, aggressive or passive-aggressive behaviour. You'll also learn about the requirements for assertive communication, such as being honest and straightforward, being respectful of others' needs and feelings and using assertive body language and tone. Finally, you'll learn about how to increase the power of your assertive communication when your first attempts don't get the results you intended.",

    "Description": "Sir Winston Churchill said 'Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.' Effective listening requires more than just courage; it also requires constant learning and practice. To prepare for effective listening, you need to identify and overcome the barriers that stand in the way of effective listening. You also need to be an attentive, empathetic and active listener. When you employ the technique of active listening, you focus your attention completely on the speaker, listen carefully for meaning and then use feedback to verify that you've correctly understood the communication. This course explores the benefits and challenges of effective listening and demonstrates how active listening techniques enhance the effectiveness of your listening skills. It takes you through the various levels of listening and outlines behaviours and thought patterns that demonstrate active listening techniques. Finally, it emphasises the important skill of providing listener feedback to demonstrate or clarify understanding of the speaker's communication.",

    "Description": "A project manager is the communication hub through whom all project information flows. A project manager may receive and distribute dozens of messages per day. Customers, suppliers, project team members, and company executives all rely on the project manager for up-to-date information. Controlling these communications is critical to the project, and it's the project manager's responsibility to ensure that the planned flow of project communications continues so that the needs of both the project stakeholders and the project itself are met. This course emphasizes the importance of the Control Communications process and guides the learner through the tools and techniques that can be used for controlling communications throughout the life of a project.

    "Description": "Walking into a meeting surrounded by unknown faces, going to conferences, attending work events, starting a new job and even going to social gatherings can be terrifying, especially if you don't know anybody who will be there. Perhaps, you worry about being ignored or not connecting with anyone and fear that awkward feeling of standing alone, off to the side. Do you wonder why people seem to be drawn to certain individuals in the room? Those individuals probably faced the same feelings of uncertainty entering the room as you did, but the difference may be that they appear to be more approachable than you do. Approachability involves conveying your willingness to reach out and invite others in by initiating contact, making yourself available and building rapport. This course is designed to give you an understanding of how to build skills to become more approachable. You'll learn about the benefits of being approachable, as well as some techniques you can use to enhance your ability to reach out and invite others in. You'll also learn about putting people at ease when you're communicating and building rapport using skills such as listening, harmonising and sharing to ensure that people see how approachable you are.",

    "Description": "It is commonly said that up to 90% of a project manager's time is spent communicating, whether it's with external stakeholders, members of the project team, suppliers, or other managers within the organization. That speaks volumes about the important role of communication to a project. When communications break down, projects fail. When communications are good, the project is more likely to achieve its objectives. Healthy project communication means that the right people are getting the right information at the right time. They are able to make informed decisions. They understand what is going on and are able to proceed with their work. Communications management is one of the most essential functions of a project manager. Project managers need to plan out a strategy to ensure that needed information is gathered and produced efficiently. In this course learners will learn how to plan and manage project communications. Learners will be introduced to best practices outlined in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) – Fifth Edition published by the Project Management Institute (PMI®).

It describes in detail how both interior (OSPFv3, IS-IS) and exterior (BGP) routing protocols exchange information and build route tables. Static route configuration is also covered.</p><p>Note: regarding interior routing protocols, the course is designed to cover either OSPFv3 or IS-IS in a standard delivery, which needs to be specified when the customer requirement is received. If training in both OSPFv3 and IS-IS is required, a customized training request must be filed to make the necessary arrangements.</p><p>To make learning more effective, the course has practical hands-on exercises for all topics, which helps the students put into practice what they learned regarding how the different SR-OS features are configured and verified.</p>",

Your people must develop an understanding of the strategy, and your work processes must be tightly aligned to maximize organizational performance. So how do you communicate strategy and secure alignment? Strategy needs to be translated from high-level themes into individual strategic goals. Otherwise, the strategy will be difficult to execute. Operational processes must work together to achieve goals because strategic progress is faster when business units are aligned, rather than working in isolation. This course offers techniques for effectively communicating a common understanding of the mission, values, and vision that drives your strategy. You'll learn how to cascade balanced scorecard objectives to help employees understand how department strategy and their personal work connect to organizational goals. The course also explains the importance of incentives to achieve objectives and of evaluating organizational competencies to develop employees who can execute your organizational strategy.</p>",

For example, project managers regularly balance many projects with varying deadlines and responsibilities – all at the same time. In a similar way, program managers must balance multiple programs, consisting of many different projects. When in a program management environment, there is an entirely new set of skills and knowledge a program manager must possess in order to be successful in this role.</p><p>This course provides an introduction to program management and the roles and responsibilities required of the program manager. Specifically, learners will be introduced to the importance of program management and the value of a program manager to the success of an organization; the differences between project, program, and portfolio management, and the interactions among them. This course provides a foundational knowledge base reflecting the most up-to-date program management information, so learners can effectively put principles to work at their own organizations. This course will assist the learner in initial preparation for the PMI® Program Management certification exam.</p><p>This course is aligned with The Standard for Program Management – Second Edition, published by the Project Management Institute (PMI®), Inc., 2008.

Busy people do what is required and rarely have the opportunity to stop and consider whether they are making the best use of their time. A brief analysis of what you do currently may surprise you, and it may help you to identify some changes that could be made. This course will help you to consider the activities that currently take up most of your time and how you plan and log them. You will also be encouraged to consider the work-life balance to which you aspire, and what steps you could take to make this wish a reality. Each of us is different, and this surely affects the way in which we approach time management. Some people habitually wake early and find that the morning is the best time for them to handle creative tasks or difficult problems; others prefer to rise and work late—these people probably prefer to tackle only easy, routine tasks in the morning. Our personalities also play a significant role in the way we handle tasks and manage time. You are probably already doing certain things well, but there will surely be areas that can be improved. The last lesson in this course will help you to approach these changes in a positive and useful way.",

It describes in detail how both interior (OSPFv3, IS-IS) and exterior (BGP) routing protocols exchange information and build route tables. Static route configuration is also covered.</p><p>Note: regarding interior routing protocols, the course is designed to cover either OSPFv3 or IS-IS in a standard delivery, which needs to be specified when the customer requirement is received. If training in both OSPFv3 and IS-IS is required, a customized training request must be filed to make the necessary arrangements.</p><p>To make learning more effective, the course has practical hands-on exercises for all topics, which helps the students put into practice what they learned regarding how the different SR-OS features are configured and verified.</p>",
